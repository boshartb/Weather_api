Steps:

1. Set an initial state for the Post component
2. Modify the render() method so it uses the body state
3. Create a changeBody() method that updates the body state
4. Add a button to the render() method that triggers changeBody()
- Use the prompt() method to ask the user for input

Bonus 1:

- When the user types in the input field, update the body dynamically
- use onChange on the input field
- Your function to handle the input change needs an event argument

Bonus #2:
- Use a form instead, and the onSubmit event of the form
- Traverse the DOM to get the value of the input
